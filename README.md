# Vaquant Expense Balance

## Use cases

- this packages exports a method that tells who need to refund who to balance a set of expenses.

## TODO

- [ ] give the refund to balance expences between accounts
- [ ] set weight in expense
- [ ] minimize transactions between accounts
- [ ] enable multiple currencies
- [ ] deal with big numbers
- [ ] deal with float numbers

## Experiences

- my head is behind my tests. I'm already thinking about how I want to minimize the number of transactions instead of just passing my test in green. Because I already know that the actual implementation will have to change.
